Standup Meeting - C Compiler Visualization Project
👋 Overview
"We built a C compiler from scratch that takes C code and turns it into machine code. Plus, we added a web interface so you can actually see what happens inside the compiler at each step."

🔧 The Compiler Pipeline (7 Stages)
Stage 1: Lexer (Tokenizer)
What it does: Breaks code into small pieces called "tokens"

becomes:

"It's like splitting a sentence into words and punctuation."

Stage 2: Parser (AST Builder)
What it does: Builds a tree structure showing how the code is organized

"The parser checks if the code makes grammatical sense - like checking if a sentence has a subject and verb in the right order."

Stage 3: Semantic Analyzer
What it does: Checks if the code makes logical sense

"Is this variable declared before use?"
"Are you adding a number to a string?" (error!)
"Is this function defined?"
"Grammar can be correct but still nonsense. This catches that."

Stage 4: IR Generation (Intermediate Representation)
What it does: Converts the AST to a simpler, flat list of instructions

"It's like translating English to a universal language before translating to French."

Stage 5: Optimization
What it does: Makes the code faster/smaller

Constant folding: 5 + 3 → 8 (calculate at compile time)
Dead code elimination: Remove code that never runs
"Why calculate something every time when you can do it once?"

Stage 6: Code Generation
What it does: Converts IR to actual x86-64 assembly

"Now we're speaking the CPU's language."

Stage 7: Assembly & Linking
What it does: Uses system tools (as, ld) to create the final executable

"Turns our assembly text file into a real program you can run."

🌐 The Web Interface (3 Parts)
Part 1: Modified Compiler (C++)
Added command-line flags to dump data at each stage:

Part 2: Flask API (Python)
A bridge between the web and the compiler:

Receives C code from the browser
Runs the compiler
Sends back tokens, AST, assembly, hex dump
Part 3: React Frontend
A visual dashboard showing:

📝 Code Editor - Write your C code
🔤 Tokens Tab - See all tokens in a table
🌳 AST Tab - Expandable tree view
⚙️ Assembly Tab - Syntax-highlighted assembly
🔢 Hex Tab - Binary output in hex format
"Type code, click compile, see everything update live."
